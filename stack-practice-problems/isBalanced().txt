we iterate through the string first, we'll use test1[] = '({[]})'

keep in mind we initialized 'char current' with the index of str in our 'for loop'

'char current = str[i]'

for the first iteration, our first index is str[0] which is '('

check if it's an opening bracket thru:

if(isOpeningBracket(current)) 

if it is an opening bracket, we push it to the stack

push(&s, current); //current is holding '(' 
 _____
|_____|
|_____| - our stack now looks like this
|__(__|

it continues to iterate until our stack looks like this:
 _____
|__[__|
|__{__| - (since the first three characters are open brackets)
|__(__|

now it reaches to ']' since it's not an opening bracket, it will move on to our 'isClosingBracket()' function

in our function we have to check if the stack is empty (if it is, it means our closing bracket doesn't have an
opening bracket.)

aka if(isEmpty(*s)==1){return 0};

we pop our last character (which in this case is '[', and compare if it's a match)

aka (isMatching(last, current) == 0){return 0}; //well in this case it checks if it ISN'T a match

where last = '[' and current = ']'

//but since it is a match, another iteration will happen in our 'for loop' until it traverses through the entire string until our stack is empty

if our stack is empty, it will return 1 otherwise 0
